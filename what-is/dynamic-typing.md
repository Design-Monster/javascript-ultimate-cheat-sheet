Dynamic Typing

JavaScript has dynamic data types, meaning that type checking is done at runtime rather than compile time.

With dynamically typed languages, a variable of the same name can be used to hold different data types.

For example, the variable t, defined as a variable by the var keyword, can be assigned to hold different data types, or can be initialized but left undefined:

var t = 16;         // t is a number
var t = "Teresa";   // t is a string
var t = true;       // t is a Boolean
var t;

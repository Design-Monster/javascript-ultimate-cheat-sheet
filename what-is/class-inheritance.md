Class inheritance inherits from classes. Generally this is outdated.

A class is like a blueprint for what you are trying to create
 Creates problems
Tight coupling (too many things are dependant on each other)
The fragile base class problem (simple changes at the base lead to huge problems down the line)
Duplication
When you inherit from a class you get EVERYTHING that was in that class, even if you donâ€™t need it

#1 - What is the difference between undefined and not defined?

Not defined means that no variable has been declared or does not exist.  It has not been created yet, but you are still trying to use it.

Undefined means that a variable has been declared but not defined.  As in:  var x; This is created but has no value set to it.  var x = 8; <- this is not undefined, it has a value set to it.
